# zkML-VeriPrice

A ZK ML Verifiable ML - For Real world Price Verification. 

# Problem Statement: 

There are many situations where consumer prices are not transparent where they have to be. There are mnay such usecases. Early implementations are just basic comparison data on what others in the neighborhood paid for. But in most situations beyond data, there are many parameters that go in to predictions for prices and that involves ML models. One such example is insurance premiums for health insurance. There is a crying need documented very heavily for price transparency in this area. 


# Solution with ZKML- VerifiableML

ZK ML offers a great mechnanism for verifiable machine learning, and inference where public data could be operated on with public models, for verifications by the consumers. 
These help in many price transparency usecases.
